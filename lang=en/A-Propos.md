#  ARTISTE, SCULPTOR, Hélène&nbsp;Yousse

Hélène Yousse creates her art with total allegiance, without concessions, out of a necessity.  
A necessity that doesn’t admit any giving up. Which draws its energy from the throbbing of an open wound, driven by the urgency to say directly what has to be said.  
What would be without this creation of art, the manipulation of matter? Loneliness, craziness, death.  

Time has no time.  
It stands in tension with the observer.  
In a relation of unbearable pain.  
They are present. So much present while they talk of absence. Of emptiness. Of farewell.
Of the passing away of a much beloved person and his unforgettable gentleness.  

Totally exhausted, petrified puppets as if spellbound within the moment, there, without a face, their skin removed, crushed from waiting. Women out of rags, puppets made of trash.  

Little by little the emptiness is being filled with sky.
The figures swing themselves up into the air – lightly – letting the light shimmer through them. Turned towards a warm and yellow sun. Like those Indians that throw themselves into the void rotating in the freedom of the air, although they are tied with their feet to the ropes, a reminder of the strict constraints of gravity.  


Hélène lives with her characters. She talks to them, touches them, caresses them. They are alive, in the kitchen or the living room, hanging from the ceiling or near the fireplace. They are thirsty for space, as she says very well: "With my characters, I have the sky in my hands.".
